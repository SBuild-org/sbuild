= How to build SBuild

SBuild is build with a previously released stable version of SBuild itself.

If you want to build the latest version of SBuild, you can check it out from SBuild's subversion repository.

svn co http://sbuild.tototec.de/svn/sbuild/trunk/sbuild sbuild

After changing into the newly created directory "sbuild", you should use the "sbuild-wrapper" to build sbuild. When executing sbuild-wrapper the first time, it will download the right version of SBuild and will use is.

cd sbuild
./sbuild-wrapper all

To build everything, including executing the tests, you should use the "all" target.
