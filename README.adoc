== How to build SBuild

SBuild is build with a previously released stable version of SBuild itself.

To build SBuild from source, you need to clone SBuild's git repository.

----
git clone http://sbuild.tototec.de/git/sbuild
----

After changing into the newly created directory "sbuild", you should use the "sbuild-wrapper" script in the project directory to build sbuild. When executing sbuild-wrapper the first time, it will download the right version of SBuild and will use is.

----
cd sbuild
./sbuild-wrapper all
----

To build everything, including executing the tests, you should use the "all" target.
