= Installation
:revversion: svn
:SBuildVersion: {revversion}


== Requirements

SBuild requires an working Java 6 Runtime. All other dependencies are bundled within the SBuild distribution ZIP file.

== Download

You can download the latest stable SBuild distribution from the http://sbuild.tototec.de/sbuild/projects/sbuild/files[download page].

== Installation 

SBuild runs under all major operating systems, that have a Java 6 Runtime environment.

=== Linux

You should check, if your Linux distribution provides ready to install packages for SBuild, 
if so, you may want to install them in the specific way of your Linux distribution.
For Gentoo Linux, you can find an https://lepetitfou.dyndns.org/svn/gentoo/lefous_portage_overlay/dev-java/sbuild-bin/[ebuild for SBuild] 
in http://lepetitfou.dyndns.org/redmine/projects/lefousportageoverlay[lefous portage overlay].

If you used the installation procedure of you Linux distribution you were done here, else continue.

Unpack the ZIP file content into a directory of your choice, e.g. +"/opt/sbuild-{SBuildVersion}"+.

Make sure, the expanded file +"/opt/sbuild-{SBuildVersion}/bin/sbuild"+ is executable, e.g. with +chmod -x /opt/sbuild-{SBuildVersion}/bin/sbuild+.

Add the binary directory (e.g. +"/opt/sbuild-{SBuildVersion}/bin/"+) to your search path: +PATH=/opt/sbuild-{SBuildVersion}/bin:$PATH+


=== Windows

Unpack the ZIP file content into an directory of your choice, e.g. +"C:\Program Files\sbuild-{SBuildVersion}"+.
After unpacking, you should see the sub directories +"bin"+, +"lib"+ and +"doc"+.

Add the environment variable +SBUILD_HOME+ with the value of that directory, e.g. +SBUILD_HOME=C:\Program Files\sbuild-{SBuildVersion}+

Add the path of the +"bin"+ directory to the +PATH+ variable: +PATH=%SBUILD_HOME%\bin:%PATH%+

[CAUTION]
.Special Notes for Cygwin Users
====
If running sbuild under cygwin, you may see the following error message:

----
$ sbuild all
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: de/tototec/sbuild/runner/SBuildRunner
Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: de.tototec.sbuild.runner.SBuildRunner
        at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(Unknown Source)

Could not find the main class: de.tototec.sbuild.runner.SBuildRunner.  Program will exit.
Exception in thread "main"
----

This is because cygwin does not execute the +sbuild.bat+ file but the +sbuild+ shell script. You may either call +sbuild.bat+ directly, or delete the +PATH/bin/sbuild+ file.
====



== Check the installation

Open an new terminal window and execute the command: +sbuild --version+

You should see something like this:

----
$ sbuild --version
SBuild 0.6.0.9002 (c) 2011 - 2013, ToToTec GbR, Tobias Roeser
----


Congratulations, you have successfully finished your SBuild installation.
