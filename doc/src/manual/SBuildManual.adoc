== Introduction

TBD

=== Declarative vs. Imperative Build Systems

TBD

// SBuild is an primarily a imperative build system. But as SBuild is also a build DSL, declarative builds can be based on top of SBuild.

== Core concepts

=== The Buildfile

SBuild's single entry point is the *Buildfile*. There are no other sources of configuration for the current project besides
the buildfile itself and those resources which are referenced from the buildfile (e.g. with +@include+).
// TODO: add a refernce to @classpath, @include etc

The Buildfile is an ordinary Scala source file and must contain a class with the same name as the buildfile or with the name +SBuild+. 
This class must have a constructor with one parameter of type +de.tototec.sbuild.Project+. 
The parameter is the reference to the current SBuild project and is used by most of SBuild's DSL as an implicit paramater. 
Because of that, is is convenient to declare the project as implicit parameter.

Here is a minimal SBuild buildfile:

[source, scala]
----
import de.tototec.sbuild._

class SBuild(implicit _project: Project)
----

NOTE: It is a best practice to store Scala source files in UTF-8 encoding. 

Because SBuild buildfiles are ordinary Scala source files, it is possible to view and edit them with any text editor but also with more
advanced editors or IDEs, to gain support for e.g. syntax highlighting or code completion.

The buildfile from above does not gain us much in its simples form. So, its time to add some targets.

=== Targets

A *target* is a named unit of work within a project. 
A target has a name and typically, but not necessarily, some dependencies and an execution block. 

Here you see a minimal buildfile with one target.

[source,scala]
----
import de.tototec.sbuild._
import de.tototec.sbuild.TargetRefs._

class SBuild(implicit _project: Project) {

  Target("phony:hello-world") dependsOn "AUTHORS.txt" exec {
    import scala.io.Source
    println("Hello World. I was written by: " + Source.fromFile("AUTHORS.txt".files.head).getLines.mkString(", "))
  }

}
----

That target +"hello-world"+ has one prerequisite +"AUTHORS.txt"+. 
As there is no other target +"AUTHORS.txt"+, the default scheme +"file"+ is applied, which means, 
+"hello-world"+ depends on the file +"AUTHORS.txt"+ in the project directory.

As there is no such file, SBuild will detect it, when it tries to run the +"hello-world"+ target.

----
$ sbuild hello-world
Initializing project...
Compiling build script: /tmp/SBuild.scala...
[0%] Executing...
[0%] Executing target: AUTHORS.txt

SBuild detected a failure in the project configuration or the build scripts.
Project: /tmp/SBuild.scala
Target:  AUTHORS.txt
Details: Don't know how to build prerequisite: AUTHORS.txt
----

Now, we have two options to solve the issue: 1) Create the file manually or 2) tell SBuild, how to create that file.

The later one could look like this:

[source,scala]
----
import de.tototec.sbuild._
import de.tototec.sbuild.TargetRefs._
import de.tototec.sbuild.ant._
import de.tototec.sbuild.ant.tasks._

@classpath("mvn:org.apache.ant:ant:1.8.4")
class SBuild(implicit _project: Project) {

  Target("phony:hello-world") dependsOn "AUTHORS.txt" exec {
    import scala.io.Source
    println("Hello World. I was written by: " + Source.fromFile("AUTHORS.txt".files.head).getLines.mkString(", "))
  }

  Target("AUTHORS.txt") exec {
    AntEcho(message = "John Doe", file = Path("AUTHORS.txt"))
  }

}
----

We added a new target +"AUTHORS.txt"+ and used the Ant Echo task to write the name "John Doe" into the file. 
Therefore, we needed to add the Ant JAR to the classpath and import SBuild's Ant support packages.

Executing SBuild again, will give use the following output:

----
$ sbuild hello-world
Initializing project...
Compiling build script: /tmp/SBuild.scala...
[0%] Executing...
[0%] Executing target: AUTHORS.txt
[50%] Finished target: AUTHORS.txt after 36 msec
[50%] Executing target: hello-world
Hello World. I was written by: John Doe
[100%] Finished target: hello-world after 2 msec
[100%] Execution finished. SBuild init time: 3514 msec, Execution time: 92 msec
----

Voil√†, this time SBuild succeeded.

If you repead the last command, you may notice a difference in the output:

----
$ sbuild hello-world
Initializing project...
[0%] Executing...
[50%] Executing target: hello-world
Hello World. I was written by: John Doe
[100%] Finished target: hello-world after 7 msec
[100%] Execution finished. SBuild init time: 253 msec, Execution time: 73 msec
----

The line +"Compiling build script: /tmp/SBuild.scala..."+ is missing. This is because, this time, the buildfile was not changed and SBuild did not need to re-compile it.

Also, this time, SBuild didn't told us, that it executed the +AUTHORS.txt+ target. This is because the +"AUTHORS.txt"+ file already existed and thus SBuild considered that target as already up-to-date.
