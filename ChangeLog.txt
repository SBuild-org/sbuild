SBuild 0.3.2.9000

* Fixed --dependencyTree not showing up on when not used with --verbose.
* Added new commandline option --list-modules to show a list of all involved
  modules (sub-projects).
* Based up-to-date detection of phony targets on virtual last modified time
  stamps instead of boolean marker.
* Reworked preorder dependency algorithm.
* Improved internally used download function, which now handles successful
  download more efficiently and does not leave temp file on download failures.
  This improves all scheme handlers as well.
* Added new commandline options --check and --check-recursive to check all 
  defined targets for cycles and potentially missing scheme handlers.
* Added new class Module which can be used to easily create target references
  to targets in that module with Module.targetRef(String) and
  Module.targetRefs(String*).
* Module() and Modules() now return a Module resp. Seq[Module].
* Deprecated Module.apply(String*) as the return value differs from
  Module.apply(String), which is not obvious. Use Modules.apply() instead.
* Build script compiler now emits deprecation warnings.
* SBuild now has slightly colored output based on jansi.fusesource.org, which
  can be disabled with --no-color commandline option.
* Improved error reporting on the commandline.
* Added TargetContext.attachFile to attach additional files to a target. Those
  files are now also included via TargetRef.files.
* TargetRef.files can now only be used inside a Target execution, and only on
  dependencies that are declared in dependsOn of that executing target.
* Added TargetContext.prerequisitesLastModified to retrieve the effective
  lastModified value of all declared dependencies.
* New ScanSchemeHandler, to scan a directory, based on a pattern and attach
  all found files to the TargetContext. That way, one can depend on a set of
  files, considering their up-to-dateness.
* New (experimental) embedded API, dedicated to SBuild embedding, e.g. in 
  SBuild Eclipse Plugin
* Fixed return value handling in shell wrapper, resulting in sbuild command
  line application always returning 0.
* Updated German translations.
* Improved tolerance for truncated last modified time stamps of files.
* Also print the target self description when executing, if any.

SBuild 0.3.2 - 2013-01-26

* Common scheme handlers (mvn, http, zip) are now registered by default, but
  can be overridden as usual.
* All by-default registered scheme handler can now be used in @classpath and
  @include elements.
* Changed behavior of --version command line option. It now exists the 
  application as expected.
* Added new AntZipFileSet for conveniene when using AntZip.
* Added new ScalaRepl addon providing access to the interactive Scala console.
* Fixed issues in parser for @classpath and @include.

SBuild 0.3.1 - 2013-01-17

* Added ability to translate/resolve (any) target ref(s) to files.
* Changed default to not use fsc when compiling build files and added new
  commandline option "--fsc" to enable fsc.
* Pathes and file dependencies pointing to symbolic links will be no longer
  implicitly resolved.
* ZipSchemeHandler: Fixed up-to-date detected issue, when a ZIP entry gets
  always reextracted.
* ZipSchemeHandler: Fixed bug, where extraction of files, that don't exists in
  ZIP file, were silently ignored.
* New BndJar Addon to generate OSGi Bundles based on bndlib.
* Fixed Windows start script.

SBuild 0.3.0 - 2013-01-04

* SBuild is now based on Scala 2.10
* ZipSchemeHandler: Fixed issue with fail of unpacking of some zip files.
* New Scalac Addon which is independent of SBuild Scalac Runtime. Thus, it is
  now possible to compile for Scala versions different than SBuild's one.
* ScalaTest Addon: Added fork option.

SBuild 0.2.0 - 2012-11-08

* A buildfile can now include other scala files. Added @include to share common
  configuration and functionality.
* Added project accessor to TargetContext.
* Added --quiet command line option to suppress percentage calculation and
  status messages. This will drastically speed up SBuild's initialization time
  for larger multi-projects, as the dependency tree is not walked trough in
  advance.
* Added arguments parameter to AntJava, as args is deprecated.
* Added more options/parameters to ScalaTest addon.
* Command line option --create-stub now tries to copy a stub from SBuild's home
  directory ($SBUILD_HOME/stub/SBuild.scala) if such one exists, before using
  a hardcoded one.

SBuild 0.1.5 - 2012-10-26

* Fixed NPE bug in AntCopy.

SBuild 0.1.4 - 2012-10-23

* Added parameters to AntZip Ant wrapper: compress, keepCompression, filesOnly,
  fileSet, fileSets
* Added parameters to AntJar Ant wrapper: compress, keepCompression, filesOnly,
  metaInf, fileSet, fileSets, manifestEntries, manifestSectionEntries, service,
  services
* Added parameter to AntCopy Ant wrapper: fileSet
* Added @configuration annotation, to declare required configuration parameters
  in a project
* Eclipse plugin: Fixed an problem with an incomplete project classpath that
  could break loading of projects in some situations.
* Eclipse plugin: Handle errors while reading the build file and retrieving
  dependencies
* Improved ZipSchemeHandler: The targetFile parameter now treats its argument
  as path relative the to project directory.
* Internal changes in classpath handling. The various classpathes SBuild needs
  when reading, compiling and executing projects are now read from a properties
  file in the installation directory, which decouples embedded solutions like
  the Eclipse Plugin and allows them to load different SBuild versions.
* Added get method to Prop object, to easily test, if an property is set.
* Eclipse plugin: Decoupled plugin version from SBuild JARs. Plugin no longer 
  includes core packages and load SBuild JARs from it installation directory.
* Ensure, ZipSchemeHandler does not overwrite files with same name from
  different archives.

SBuild 0.1.3 - 2012-10-18

* Improved classloading for ScalaTest and JUnit addons.
* Incompatible API change: SchemeHandler can now have dependencies, when 
  implementing the trait SchemeHandlerWithDependencies and have access to them
  through the TargetContext, which will be given as parameter into resolve
  method.
* Added new ZipSchemeHandler to reference zipped resources, a typical use case
  for original online dependencies like TestNG, JUnit or SWT.
* Fixed a bug, where the self-evaluated up-to-date state of phony targets was
  lost causing some unnecessary executions.

SBuild 0.1.2 - 2012-10-04

* Fixed cross-project dependency resolution problem for file targets.

SBuild 0.1.1 - 2012-09-26

* SBuild now builds itself. SBuild-0.1.0 is required. :-)
* SchemeHandler API changed: Return value of resolve-method changed to
  ResolveResult.
* Added new parameter forceDownload to HttpSchemeHandler.
* Improved/fixed up-to-date detection for prerequisites/dependencies from
  different projects.
* Only targets defined in buildfiles will be shown with --list and
  --list-recursive, implicitly create targets will be not.
* Improved error messages.
* Improved logging.
* Added new commandline option --dependency-tree to show the dependency tree
  for the requested targets.
* Better cycle-detecting in target dependencies.
* Better detection, if the buildfile needs recompilation in case that different
  versions of SBuild are used.
* Run SBuild JVM with more PermGemSpace to avoid OutOfMemoryErrors.
* New Eclipse Plugin that is able the provide a classpath container based on
  an SBuild buildfile. Therefore the function ExportDependencies was added.
* Removed parameter dir:String from AntMkDir.
* Added parameter fileSets to AntCopy.
* Added parameter jvmArgs to AntScalac.
* Added parameter failOnError to AntJava.
* Added a lot of new parameter to AntJavac.
* Added parameter envs to AntEcec.
* Added addon ScalaTest.
* Added addon JUnit.

SBuild 0.1.0 - 2012-07-29
